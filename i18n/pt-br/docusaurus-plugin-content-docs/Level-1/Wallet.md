Ethereum wallets are applications that let you interact with your Ethereum account. Think of it like an internet banking app â€“ without the bank. Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications.

You need a wallet to send funds and manage your ETH.

Your wallet is only a tool for managing your Ethereum account. That means you can swap wallet providers at any time. Many wallets also let you manage several Ethereum accounts from one application.
