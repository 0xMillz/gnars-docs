## What is Gnars DAO?

Gnars DAO is a permissionless, open-source community and action sports accelerator, created to support athletes, creators, and enthusiasts in growing the world of extreme sports. As a community-owned brand, Gnars brings shredders “onchain,” helping them gain visibility and get rewarded for their creativity and impact. It’s a collaborative space where people can directly contribute to the culture through shared decision-making and decentralized collaboration.

### How it Works

Gnars operates as a global collective of athletes and supporters, using a decentralized governance system to decide how to best support its members and fund initiatives. By participating, you’re not just a member—you’re part of a community driving the future of action sports and the creator economy.

In practical terms, Gnars makes use of cutting-edge technology to bring creators and athletes online in a way that was previously unimaginable. Just like getting online in the 90s changed the game, getting onchain today is revolutionizing how athletes and creators connect with their audiences. Through ongoing auctions, community members fund a shared treasury, and all decisions on spending are made collectively.

### Upload + Earn = Stoke

Getting involved is simple. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Sign up for ThatsGnarly with your email.**  
2. **Upload your content (make it free).**  
3. **Earn rewards from collectors.**

When you upload your work to ThatsGnarly, you can make your creations free to collect. This means you’ll earn protocol rewards whenever collectors engage with your content. Even first-time collectors and people who refer others earn rewards, making the whole process frictionless and accessible.

This streamlined experience means you can onboard without needing to go through complex steps like KYC, buying crypto, or even installing a wallet. Once you’ve got your content online, you’re set to start earning Ethereum from your collectors and contributors—simple as that.

### A Community-Driven Brand

The goal of Gnars is to grow a community-owned brand that is built by its members, for its members. Our projects range from public goods like skatepark refurbishments to creative endeavors like film projects and community-led events. We focus on initiatives that build up the extreme sports community and support creators on their journey, no matter where they’re starting from.

### Why Join?

Gnars isn’t just about funding—it’s about creating opportunities. It’s a permissionless space where anyone can propose and support ideas that push the boundaries of creativity and sport. From seasoned skaters to newcomers, everyone has a voice in how the community evolves. With no gatekeepers, everyone has the chance to contribute.

### Getting Started

After you’ve uploaded your first piece of content, come join us in the community. We hang out on Discord and post updates on Twitter, Warpcast, and Instagram. If you’re interested in being part of the decision-making process, you can even use your earnings to bid on our community NFT auctions, giving you a say in how we allocate our treasury.

### Shred for Bread

The whole point is to have fun and make an impact—whether you’re uploading skate videos, supporting local projects, or getting involved in new initiatives. We’re here to bring a million shredders onchain, so they can experience firsthand that there’s more to being a creator than chasing likes.

Why not start by uploading one of your Instagram clips to ThatsGnarly right now? Pop into our Discord server to let us know, and we’ll be stoked to collect it!

### Community First

Gnars is headless by design, meaning there’s no central authority—just a group of passionate creators and athletes working together to build something that benefits everyone. That’s what makes us unique as a community-owned brand. ⌐◨-◨
