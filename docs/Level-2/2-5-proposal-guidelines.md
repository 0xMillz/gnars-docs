# 2.5) Proposal Guidelines
[How To Create Snapshot Proposals - Gnars](https://gnars.com/create-snapshot-proposals/)

ðŸ’¡ You need 12 Gnars to create a proposal on Gnars Snapshot. Someone can sponsor your proposal if you donâ€™t have enough Gnars to do so, but ideally this person should offer to you, itâ€™s not cool to ask for it.


ðŸ’¡ After having your outstanding idea, talk to the community in our discord, if you receive a good feedback from the community and you have a GNAR you will be able to create a post in our Discord, under #Proposals room, again wait for the community feedback for at least 3 days and then post in snapshot following this tutorial.


ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. In under 2000 characters, describe your initiative in the #Proposal-Forum 
2. To give your proposal a better chance of success, try to answer these questions:

    - What specific outcomes will happen as a result of the funding?
    - How do these outcomes bring value to the Gnars Dao?
    - How can success be measured?
    - How long will the project take?
    - How long will the funding last?


# Process

---

1. Once you have an idea for a proposal that youâ€™d like to pitch to the DAO, create a thread in the Proposals Forum within discord to share your idea and seek community feedback. The proposals forums is linked below.
    
    [https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/996191296119111864](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/996191296119111864)
    
2. The first post in the channel should include as much information as possible. Utilize the typical proposal outline below and include as many details as you can and request feedback on specifics that you have not worked out yet. Please include links to previous work, social media, and a link to your HackMD/google docs proposal if you have already written one.
3. Discuss and revise the proposal as necessary based on community feedback. Be sure to join the weekly board meetings to discuss your idea.
4. Once the community is satisfied with the contents of the proposal, submit your proposal to the DAOâ€™s snapshot.
