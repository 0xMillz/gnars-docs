### What Can Gnar NFTs Do?

Gnar NFTs are much more than just digital collectibles. They serve as versatile assets that unlock a variety of benefits and governance rights for their holders across multiple platforms and communities. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what Gnar NFTs can do:

#### **1. Governance**
Gnar NFTs are used as votes in the **Gnars DAO** governance process. Each Gnar represents a voting unit, empowering its holder to participate in crucial decisions that shape the future of the DAO. Whether it's funding skate projects, supporting community initiatives, or voting on the DAO’s operational matters, Gnar NFTs ensure that every holder has a say.

**1 GNAR === 1 VOTE**

#### **2. Noggle Coins Rewards**
Gnars holders earn **Noggle Coins**, which are a form of reward distributed through specific activities and contributions to the community. Noggle Coins can be used for various perks, redemptions, and engagement incentives, further enhancing the value of holding a Gnar NFT.

#### **3. Voting on Polls on Farcaster**
With your Gnar NFT, you can cast votes on **Warpcast** polls and engage with the community directly on **Farcaster**. These polls cover a range of topics, from minor decisions to more impactful community votes, giving you a platform to express your preferences.

#### **4. Free Account on SurfGuru**
All Gnars NFT holders are eligible for a **free premium account on SurfGuru**, a surf forecasting and community platform that offers advanced weather data, community engagement features, and premium content. This benefit bridges the gap between surfing and skateboarding communities, extending value beyond traditional skateboarding perks.

#### **5. Voting on Nouns through Community Delegation**
Gnars holders can participate in **Nouns DAO governance** through community delegation, allowing the collective Gnars voice to be heard in one of the most prominent decentralized communities. This provides indirect influence over major funding and public goods initiatives, bridging the Gnar ethos with the Nouns DAO.

#### **6. Voting on That’s Gnarly Mints**
Gnars holders have exclusive rights to **vote on the next skateboarding mints** featured on **That’s Gnarly**. This gives the community a chance to uplift talented skaters and determine which clips get minted as NFTs, supporting creators directly through their votes.

#### **7. Voting Power on Communities Like Skatehive**
Gnars NFTs grant voting power in adjacent skateboarding communities like **Skatehive**, a blockchain-based skateboarding community where skaters use their Gnars to influence content curation, events, and broader community decisions.

#### **8. Discounts at Skateshops**
Select **skateshops** and skate-related brands offer **special discounts** for Gnars holders, giving you real-world perks and savings on gear, merch, and services. These partnerships continue to grow, providing tangible benefits that extend beyond the digital space.

#### **9. Exclusive Access to Events and Content**
Gnars holders often receive **exclusive access** to special events, including meetups, skate sessions, and video premieres. This might include invites to private Discord channels, early access to new content, or even physical-world gatherings.

#### **10. Membership Perks Across Decentralized Communities**
Because of their affiliation with decentralized networks, Gnars holders can access a range of **perks across interconnected communities**. This can include access to private groups, voting rights in affiliated DAOs, or collaborative projects that span multiple skateboarding and creative communities.

#### **11. Representation and Influence**
Holding a Gnar NFT makes you an ambassador of the Gnars ethos. Whether through governance, collaborations, or community projects, your Gnar serves as a badge of participation, influence, and support for the culture of decentralized skateboarding.

If there’s a new feature or perk introduced, Gnar NFTs will always be the key to unlocking it. Keep exploring and using your Gnar NFT as the community and ecosystem continue to expand!
