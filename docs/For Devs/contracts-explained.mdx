# Gnars Contracts Explained

## Background

Gnars DAO is a suite of five smart contracts on the BASE Ethereum Layer 2 chain. Membership and voting power in the DAO are represented by NFTs, which are minted and distributed in a perpetual auction format. The following describes the mechanisms that power the Gnars DAO and what each component smart contract entails.

## Contracts

| Contract                                                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [1. Token](https://basescan.org/address/0x880Fb3Cf5c6Cc2d7DFC13a993E839a9411200C17)              | This is the Gnars ERC-721 NFT contract. Each NFT represents membership in the DAO, and the number of NFTs owned is directly proportional to your voting power in governance proposals. The two main roles are `minter` and `owner`. The `minter` is set to the Auction House contract in the constructor, and the `owner` is assigned to the DAO after deployment.                                                                                                                                                      |
| [2. Auction House](https://basescan.org/address/0x494Eaa55ECF6310658B8fC004b0888DCB698097f)      | This contract acts as a generation and distribution mechanism for new Gnars NFTs, minting as many as one Gnar every 80 minutes. Auction proceeds (ETH) are automatically deposited into the DAO's treasury. Each time an auction is manually settled, the settlement transaction will also cause a new auction to begin. While settlement is most heavily incentivized for the winning bidder, it can be triggered by anyone, allowing the auction to trustlessly run forever as long as there are interested bidders.   |
| [3. Treasury](https://basescan.org/address/0x72aD986ebAc0246D2b3c565ab2a1ce3a14cE6f88)           | This contract is the treasury, or bank account, for the Gnars DAO. It holds the DAO's assets and disperses transactions based on the outcome of governance proposals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [4. Governor](https://basescan.org/address/0x3dd4e53a232B7B715c9ae455f4e732465eD71b4c)           | This contract is based on Compound's `GovernorBravoDelegator`. It contains the logic for creating, voting, and executing governance proposals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [5. Metadata Renderer](https://basescan.org/address/0xdc9799d424EbFDCF5310f3bad3dDCcE3931d4b58)  | This contract contains the logic to dynamically generate and display metadata for each Gnars NFT. This metadata includes essential information about the NFT, such as its name, description, attributes, and associated images.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Terminology

- **Metadata**: Data associated with an NFT, such as name, description, and image link.
- **Auction Duration**: How often a new NFT is created and put up for auction.
- **Auction Reserve Price**: Minimum bid required to start an auction.
- **Proposal Threshold**: Minimum BPS of total votes (NFTs) needed to put a proposal to a vote.
- **Quorum Threshold**: Minimum BPS of total "For" votes (NFTs) required for a proposal to pass.
- **NFT Image Properties**: Image components used for creating the NFTs.
- **Founders and Allocations**: Configurable rewards for DAO founders, including different allocations.

## Builder Protocol Rewards

The Builder protocol is a tool that was used to migrate Gnars DAO from Ethereum Layer 1 to BASE Layer 2. The following values are set by Builder at the protocol level and cannot be changed:

- **Builder reward**: 2.5% of final auction value
- **Referral reward**: 2.5% of final auction value
- **Founder reward**: 0% of final auction value

## Gnarly Fun Facts

- 1 out of every 10 newly minted Gnars NFTs (IDs ending in 7) are not put on auction. Rather, they are airdropped to shredders from proposals.
- The NFT artwork used at the time of the BASE launch is an off-chain Gnars HD collection by ilustradora.eth. This is because the legacy Layer 1 on-chain pixel art images were not compatible with the Builder protocol. Future plans are to swap out the current off-chain art with fully on-chain art.
- Legacy mainnet Gnars have the same IDs as those migrated to BASE, however, the trait combinations are different. They will continue to function as both collectibles and voting tokens on mainnet, as the mainnet DAO will continue to exist immutably and indefinitely on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Gnars NFTs with IDs 0 through 626 never existed on mainnet and are known as the Gnars OG collection. As such, they were never integrated with governance. As part of the BASE migration, however, they were minted and airdropped to the treasury. They will be used to raise additional revenue for the DAO via various marketing and promotional efforts.
