Nouns is an online community built around NFTs or digital art as an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities.

All Nouns NFTs characters wear an eyewear called noggles making it the Nouns main symbol. 

## OK, but whats this all have to do with Gnars? 

Gnars is a DAO funded by Nouns not only as an action sports extension, but also as a community-owned brand that values creativity and participation. It's a community dedicated to supporting the artistry of extreme athletes, encouraging individuals to bring their shredding talents onchain and offering compensation for their contribution. It allows extreme athletes to earn through their content, making the Gnars ecosystem a lucrative platform for those passionate about action sports and digital artistry.

This connection between DAOs made Noggles also the main symbol of Gnars, sometimes just with a little detail on the middle for distinction.

## How can I rock some Noggles?

You can start by getting into the Nouns enviroment through the main platforms such as Warpcast, Nounspace, Zora (adcionar mais) and use your creativity to create and engage in some Nounish content. Digital artists, videomakers and every type of artist are creating content based around the Noggles.
Even if you aren't that inclined to art you can be a part of the comunity, it values every person that comes in with a Nounish attitude. 


Nowadays you can find the Noggles not only as a online symbol, but also physically. Companies like Precious Plastics and Nounsworks have already made physical versions of the Noggles as real eyewear, shirts, bags, keychains and other type os apparels.

## Thats so cool! But are the Noggles public domain?

Yes! The Noggles fit in what we call CC0. 

Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licenses are referred to as the “no rights reserved” option and it’s equivalent to content in the public domain. It’s not exactly the same thing, but it’s one of the simplest ways for creators to distribute their copyrighted works free of any use restrictions.

Using the Noggles as a symbol of shared governance and identity within the Gnars and broader Nouns ecosystem represents the essence of innovation in merging digital art with real-world communities. So everytime you see these stylish glasses you can always envision the Nounish enviroment that the community strives for.
