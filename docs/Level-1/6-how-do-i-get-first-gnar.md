There are a few ways you can obtain a GNAR NFT (Non-Fungible Token):

1. Buy it on the open market: You can buy a GNAR NFT on a marketplace such as OpenSea, Rarible, or SuperRare. To do this, you will need to have a cryptocurrency wallet that is compatible with the platform you are using, and you will need to have the necessary funds in your wallet to make the purchase.

2. Participate in a sale or auction: GNAR NFTs may be made available for sale or auction at various times. Keep an eye out for announcements or follow the GNAR team on social media to stay informed about upcoming sales or auctions.

3. Earn it as a reward: GNAR NFTs may be given out as rewards or incentives to members of the GNAR community. This could be for participating in a contest, completing a task, or contributing to the project in some way.
4. If you are an Athlete: ask someone to make a proposal for you !

I hope this information is helpful! If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
