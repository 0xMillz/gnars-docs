# 3.3) What is CC0?

CC0 is a type of Creative Commons license that was first introduced in 2007. However, it was not until 2016 that it gained widespread attention. Unlike traditional copyright licenses, which reserve all rights to the creator, CC0 "No Rights Reserved" license offers a way for creators to waive all their rights, effectively making their work part of the public domain. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the work without any restrictions or permissions from the original creator.

Under a CC0 license, you can take the creator's work and use it in any way you see fit, whether it be for personal or commercial use. This means you can use the work as inspiration for your own creations, incorporate it into your own projects, or even sell it as part of a larger work. CC0 licensing offers complete freedom and flexibility to anyone who wants to use the work, without fear of infringing on the creator's rights or having to pay licensing fees.

The beauty of CC0 licensing lies in its ability to promote creativity and collaboration. By making works available for free, creators can spark new ideas and inspire others to build upon their work. This can lead to a chain reaction of creativity that benefits everyone involved, from the original creator to those who use and build upon their work.

In addition to promoting creativity, CC0 licensing can also be a powerful tool for advancing social causes and promoting cultural heritage. By making works available for free, creators can help preserve cultural artifacts and promote awareness of important issues. This can help ensure that these works are accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial resources.

Overall, CC0 licensing is an important development in the world of copyright and intellectual property. By promoting freedom and collaboration, it has the potential to transform the way we think about creative works and their value to society.
