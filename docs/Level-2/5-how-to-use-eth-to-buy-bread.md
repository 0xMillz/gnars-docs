# How to Use ETH to Buy Bread

While using ETH to buy everyday items like bread isnâ€™t widespread yet, there are some strategies you can use to make it work. First, try to get your local skateshop or favorite business to accept ETH payments directly. Here are some arguments you can use to convince them:

## Convincing Your Local Skateshop to Accept ETH

### 1. **Marketing and Visibility**
By accepting ETH, they can attract a new customer base and gain exposure in the crypto community. Itâ€™s a unique selling point that differentiates them from competitors and could lead to free promotion on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.

### 2. **Lower Transaction Fees**
Traditional payment systems like credit cards have high fees, often up to 3-5%. Accepting ETH could lower these costs, especially using solutions like Layer 2 networks, which have minimal transaction fees compared to traditional banks.

### 3. **Global Reach**
ETH is borderless, making it easy for international customers to buy products without dealing with exchange rates and banking intermediaries. This opens up potential for online sales and cross-border transactions.

### 4. **Security and No Chargebacks**
Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are final, eliminating the risk of chargebacks or fraudulent reversals that can happen with credit card payments.

### 5. **Future-Proofing**
Integrating crypto payments shows that the business is forward-thinking and open to innovation. As adoption grows, being early to accept ETH can become a competitive advantage.
