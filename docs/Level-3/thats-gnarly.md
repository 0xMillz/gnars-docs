# 3.1) Thatsgnar.ly - NFT Social media powered by Gnars

# What's up GNARly people?

A week ago [Gnars community](https://www.discord.gg/gnars) launched [ThatsGnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly/), a new social movement owned by the extreme sports community where athletes and creators earn money for content they create.

# How Does It Work?

Content creators [submit their extreme sports clips and photos](https://thatsgnar.ly/create), Gnars community votes on their favourite content and top voted content of the day gets featured in [Thatsgnar.ly Daily Drop](https://thatsgnar.ly/edition).

Extreme sports fans and the #Thatsgnarly community collect the Daily Drop via an open edition NFT auction for 0.0069 ETH/piece. 50% of ETH raised are going to content creator and the other 50% goes to [Gnars.DAO Treasury](https://gnars.wtf/).

# Why Does It Matter

Athletes and content creators are incredibly under-supported in today's world. Most don't make any money, and the ones that do make a fraction of what they should.

Thatâ€™s Gnarly is a new way for athletes and creators to earn money for their skills without having to sell themselves and their content out to a corporation. It empowers people to take ownership of whats rightfully theirs.

Fans around the world can support their favorite athletes and creators directly by collecting their favorite clips and getting their heroes paid directly.

We believe in a future where creatives can be paid the real value of their work and fans can support their favorite movements and heroes directly.

Extreme sports should be owned by the people, not Red Bull.

# WTF is GNARS?!?

[Gnars](https://gnars.com) are a new way to fund extreme athletes. We prefer a world where kids arenâ€™t shilled energy drinks by their heroes. So as a community of action sports enthusiasts, weâ€™ve formed a DAO to rethink how extreme sports people get sponsored.

Based on [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/) open source code and CC0 artwork, Gnars are stored fully on-chain on Ethereum with no external dependencies (not even IPFS), and each one represents a DAO vote. Weâ€™re changing the way extreme sport is funded as stewards of Nouns Athletes with backing from Nouns DAO.
